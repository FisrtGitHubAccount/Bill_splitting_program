# Bill_splitting_program
Have you ever experienced difficulties in trasnferring money between a group of friends?
If there is only one person paying, the solution is trivial, which is everyone transferring the appropriate amount to the payer.
However, things get complicated when there is more than one person paying for the shared things. The simplest solution will become increasing more inefficent in that everyone is trasnferring money back and forth. Moreover, some people might not use everything so some are supposed to pay less than others. This program was written to overcome the complicated bill splitting problems that are common than you'd think.

The main idea is to assign the total balance of things they used and paid for. Then minimise the number of the total transactions by using ??? algorithm (don't know its name).
